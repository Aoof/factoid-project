// Sample data to test your program
string data = "The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions. The first high-level programming language was created by Konrad Zuse in 1943. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951. Konrad Zuse was born on 1910/06/22, in GERMANY, and was a notable civil engineer, pioneering computer scientist, inventor, and businessman.";

// Implement the following functions

// 1. GetPeople
// This function should return an array of all the people mentioned in the given string.
// A person's name based on the format we've been given is a word that starts with 
// an uppercase letter and is followed by lowercase letters.
string[] GetPeople(string sentence)
{
    // Implement your solution here using the `sentence` variable above
    return new string[] { }; // You will need to change this line to return the actual result
}

// 2. GetPlaces
// This function should return an array of all the places mentioned in the given string.
// A place based on the format we've been given is a word that is in all uppercase letters.
string[] GetPlaces(string sentence)
{
    // Implement your solution here using the `sentence` variable above
    return new string[] { }; // You will need to change this line to return the actual result
}

// 3. RetrieveData
// This function should return the data split into sentences.
// A sentence ends with a period (.) a question mark (?) or an exclamation mark (!).
string[] RetrieveData()
{
    // Implement your solution here using `data` variable
    return new string[] {};
