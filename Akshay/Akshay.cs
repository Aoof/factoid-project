// Sample data to test your program
string data = "The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions. The first high-level programming language was created by Konrad Zuse in 1943. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951. Konrad Zuse was born on 1910/06/22, in GERMANY, and was a notable civil engineer, pioneering computer scientist, inventor, and businessman.";

// Implement the following functions

// 1. RemoveStopWords
// This function should remove all the stop words from the given string and return the result.
// Stop words are common words that are filtered out from search and natural language processing.
// Examples of stop words: "a", "an", "the", "in", "on", "at", "to", "for", "of", "with", "by", "and", "or", "but"
string RemoveStopWords(string str)
{
    // Implement your solution here using the `data` variable above
    return ""; // You will need to change this line to return the actual result
}

// 2. GetDates
// This function should return an array of all the dates mentioned in the given string.
// A date based on the format we've been given is a word that is in the format YYYY/MM/DD.
// We should also consider dates that are in the format YYYY-MM-DD, any year from 1000 to 3999. 
string[] GetDates(string sentence)
{
    // Implement your solution here using the `sentence` variable above
    return new string[] { }; // You will need to change this line to return the actual result
}

// 3. GetNumbers
// This function should return an array of all the numbers mentioned in the given string.
// A number is either monetary value, percentage, or any other numerical value.
string[] GetNumbers(string sentence)
{
    // Implement your solution here using the `sentence` variable above
    return new string[] { }; // You will need to change this line to return the actual result
}
